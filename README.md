# arduino-bnc-case
A 3D-printable snap-fit case which was designed to host an [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3) to be used with [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/Arduino). The seven holes in the top part of the enclosure can host BNC connectors (we used [these ones](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/coaxial-connectors/1617207)). The lone connector on the top right can be used as the input, and the remaining ones as outputs 8-13.
